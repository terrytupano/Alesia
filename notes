on analisis time, first keep only the x max played hads, this remove noisy simulations parameters, the trooper with good estrategi, sollte those noisy parameters überwinden

- simulate the optimal upperboud of handsranks: motiviation: better probability calculation when there is extremely rare to find a hand like royal flush or straith flus
- simulation to compute the preflop % based on num of villans (the result were something like villans*10)

- read: artikle über Return on Investment (ROI)
- lowe limit in roi formula: 10% lower limmit in a bussines is 30% (read literature about it) maybe is util to make a table with detail investments 
- make a ROI formula: ROI = (Winnings - Investment) / Investment take into acount any moment in play when bet > lower limitn (roucht 10%)of roi , fold hero mus play until lower limit but once the limit is errreichen, dont gepardice any more also consider playtime 



ICM calculation
Independent Chip Model (ICM) is a model to calculate the dollar value of tournament chips, It is important that you understand the difference between expected value in chips (cEV) and expected value in dollars ($EV) if you are playing poker tournaments such as Sit and Go�s, Double or Nothing�s or MTT�s,

push/fold calculation
Push-Fold Charts are mathematically solved hand ranges arranged into a simple chart to help you play perfect, preflop poker while short-stacked in tournaments, These charts are designed to be used when players are short-stacked, because players are in a �push-fold� mode: their preflop decisions are limited to �pushing� all-in or folding,
