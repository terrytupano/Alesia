ICM calculation
Independent Chip Model (ICM) is a model to calculate the dollar value of tournament chips. It is important that you understand the difference between expected value in chips (cEV) and expected value in dollars ($EV) if you are playing poker tournaments such as Sit and Go’s, Double or Nothing’s or MTT’s.

push/fold calculation
Push-Fold Charts are mathematically solved hand ranges arranged into a simple chart to help you play perfect, preflop poker while short-stacked in tournaments. These charts are designed to be used when players are short-stacked, because players are in a “push-fold” mode: their preflop decisions are limited to “pushing” all-in or folding.
